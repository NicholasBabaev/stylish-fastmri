Repository with final project for Deep Learning course (by Victor Lempitsky)

# TODO:

- [x] [Anton] Code simple VAE / Research more sophisticated VAEs or alternatives and implement
- [x] [Elmira] Find an architecture for details extractor and try training with/without transfer learning
- [x] [Leonid] Combine generator in StyleGAN fashion
- [x] [Nicholas] Code generative component (discriminator and loss)
- [x] [Nazerke] Design loss
- [x] [Nazerke] Fourier (lp/hp filters) supplement for details extractor
- [x] [Ghaith] Experiments management + GANsformer
